Spells out words using the periodic table

## How it works
Enter some text and receive the same text spelled out using elements from the periodic table.
Unfortunately, the "translation" will not be completely perfect, mostly because, obviously, not every two-letter combination exists on the periodic table.
Nevertheless, I tried my best.
